This is my App code, i want to build this as Flask app, i already have a github repo and in the root , i have app.py, templates, static and in templates there is index.html, static styles.css and script.js, So give file specific code seperating html, css, js




Analysis
I will help you convert your existing HTML application into a Flask application. This will involve separating your current single HTML file into index.html (for the HTML structure), styles.css (for CSS rules), and script.js (for JavaScript logic). I will also create an app.py file to handle the Flask routes and rendering.

Here are the file-specific codes:

Here's how to set up your Flask project structure:

app.py: Place the Flask application code in your project's root directory.
templates/index.html: Create a directory named templates in your root directory and place the index.html file inside it. Flask will automatically look for HTML templates in this folder.
static/styles.css: Create a directory named static in your root directory, and inside static, create styles.css. Place the CSS code here.
static/script.js: Place the JavaScript code inside the static directory as script.js.
To run your Flask app:

Install Flask: If you haven't already, install Flask using pip:
Bash

pip install Flask
Run the app: Navigate to your project's root directory in your terminal and run:
Bash

python app.py
You should then be able to access your Smart Register application by navigating to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (or the address shown in your terminal) in your web browser.

This setup ensures a clear separation of concerns, making your application more organized and maintainable as a Flask project.

app.py
Python

# app.py
from flask import Flask, render_template, redirect, url_for, request, session
import os

app = Flask(__name__)
# Set a secret key for session management (required even if not explicitly used for Flask-Login, etc.)
# It's good practice for Flask apps. For a real app, use a strong, environment variable.
app.secret_key = os.urandom(24) # Generates a random secret key

@app.route('/')
def index():
    """
    Renders the main index.html template for the Smart Register application.
    The client-side JavaScript will handle authentication redirection.
    """
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/login', methods=['GET'])
def login_page():
    """
    Renders the dedicated login.html template.
    """
    return render_template('login.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Run the Flask application in debug mode for development
    app.run(debug=True)
